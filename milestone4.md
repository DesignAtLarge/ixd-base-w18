For this part of the milestone, we made frontend and functionality changes to the main page. The page is now centered and refined with accented colors. The individual search results are grouped into individual items that are color coded, and they are each clickable. Each object (search result) is dynamic, and once they are clicked on, they will lead to their corresponding detail page.

For future improvements, we plan on making the color scheme more consistent, as well as having the individual items lined up fully vertically. They will be wider rectangles instetad of taller ones, and we will also create a logo image to put into the header.

On the details page, the trail title is dynamically populated. The other parts are still in progress. The interface to add images has been added to the page as well.

The UI will later be focusing on making the map location appear with the trackers in the future as well as displaying comments dynamically. The preview of the image before upload will be implemented for the next milestone. The comments and the images referring to the comments will be side by side.

The comments do not show up right now, but they are being uploaded and stored to the database. We're using firebase for our main database, and we're using the firebase storage to ultimatly store images.


Our focus in user privacy is in that the user can decide to make their commentaries on the trail anonymous if they wish, but otherwise display their information. We wanted to have a control of how much a user can show themselves with other users by implementing this system.
