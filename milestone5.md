The UI for the second page of the application, the page dedicated a specific trail didn't change as much; however,
an actual map that represents the trail now shows up on the page. Comments and images are also displayed if there are
comments and images that are submitted using the submission form that is located below the map. This is evident on the
first image, it displays a map trail of Torrey Pines State Reserve Loop and no submitted comments and images; on the other
hand, the second image  displays a map trail of Mission Trail Loops along with the submitted comments and image. Moreover,
there is now just one submit button for submitting an image and a comment (Submitting an image is optional).
