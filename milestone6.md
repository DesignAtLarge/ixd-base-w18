UI Improvements:
Several improvements have been made to the user interface since milestone 5 in order to increase the
usability of our web-based application. One of the improvements that the team deemed necessary is the
inclusion of a home/back button built directly into the page itself, located in the title bar. This
allows the user to travel back to the home page of our website regardless of where they are in the 
application. Another improvement that was included in this milestone was the updated functionality of 
the search bar located on the home page. Before, the search bar was only usable through clicking the
search button after entering in a location as in put. However, the search bar can now be used via the
enter key on a user's keyboard. This brings expected functionality to the user.

Data Visualization Explanation:
Our web-based application allows the user to visualize data from the home page. This is done via user 
input in the search bar provided. Once the user enters a valid location (provided by Google Maps), the 
application will then look up the location in the hiking trail API and provide the user with a list of 
valid trails in the surrounding area. All trails will immediately be displayed for the user to see. 
Several pieces of information will be shown to the user in regards to each trail. These include the name
of the trail, a summary of the trail experience, a difficulty rating, and the average user review.
