The main difference between the paper prototypes and the actual implementations of our 
implemented screens is the reduction in the amount of pages that we have for the app in order to focus
on the main functionality of our app: to provide the nearest hiking trails and be able to
comment on specific parts of the trail. Currently, user login, sign up, and user profile were 
removed and will be added if the team has enough time. However, the pages that were kept is the page that 
displays the nearest hikes, and the page that displays further information and allows user commenting 
about a specific hike.

Compared to the paper prototypes, the "find hike" page became the home page of the app and it has one 
search bar instead of multiple search bars. Instead of displaying a table of trails and details 
pertaining to the trails, a centered list of images and details are shown to the user after a search.
The details pertaining to the trails that will be displayed will only be the name of the trail, the 
rating of the trail, how many people rated the trail,the summary of about the trail ,and the difficulty 
of the trail (The city the trail is located and the distance the trail covers was removed because the 
search bar already provides trails near the user along with the difficulty level of the trail). The 
nav bar was also removed because it is no longer needed. 

Furthermore, the second page of the application: the page that allows users to add pictures and comments
at specific parts of the trail was kept relatively the same; a map of the trail with markers will still 
be displayed, a comment box to submit comments, and a Reddit style comment stream would still be used.
